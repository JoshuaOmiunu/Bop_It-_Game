# Bop_It-_Game
I developed a Simon Says ''Bop It!'' (HTML)game  where the user has to keep up with the game which will randomly generate a colour which is highlighted; where now the user has to click as their score goes while a pressure timer is going. When the user presses the wrong button and indication will flash to let them know the game is over.
